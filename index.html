            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p class="aboutMe">
                Hey there! My name is Mayza Costa Barbosa. I'm from São Luís city in Maranhão state. São Luís is a small island in the northern part of Brazil, 
                known as the island of love. I absolutely love learning new things, diving into books, and anything related to music and creativity. 
                My favorite bands are ABBA, Bee Gees, and Queen, but I also adore musicians like Cyndi Lauper and Michael Jackson. 
                My grandma influenced my music taste, so I guess you could say I have an old soul—I just love music from the 60s to the 90s.

                Brazil is the largest country in South America, known for its vibrant culture and diverse landscapes. It boasts the Amazon Rainforest, 
                which is the world's largest tropical rainforest and home to an incredible variety of wildlife. The country is famous for its lively festivals, 
                especially Carnival, which features samba music, colorful parades, and street parties. One fascinating aspect of Brazilian culture is 
                its rich musical heritage. Brazil has produced many influential music genres, including bossa nova, forró, and tropicalia. 
                Samba, perhaps the most iconic, is not just a music style but a symbol of national identity. The infectious rhythms of samba can be 
                heard throughout the country, particularly during Carnival, when cities come alive with music and dance.
